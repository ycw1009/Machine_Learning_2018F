===
## Spec
- MLHW2.pdf
## Problems
1. P1 - Single Variable Linear regression with built-in function
2. P2 - Single Variable Linear regression by own grident descent
3. P3 - Mutiple Variables Linear regression by own grdient descent
4. P4 - Polynomial regression by own gradient descent
5. bonus - Change Models to make the r2 > 0.87
	- After doing data pre-processing in P4, it successed.
## environment
- python 3.6
- requirements
	- numpy, matplotlib, pandas, scikitlearn
